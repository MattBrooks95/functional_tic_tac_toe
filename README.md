# functional_tic_tac_toe
implemented tic tac toe to try and become more familiar with haskell, and to prove to myself that games can be made without mutable state

I originally built the application with Cabal, but I'm didn't check in the cabal stuff because I had no idea what it was doing.

I've since gotten used to using stack, so I converted the project to use stack instead
